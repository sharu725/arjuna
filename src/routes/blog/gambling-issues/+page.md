title: Lost everything to gambling.
---

In the epic saga of the **Mahabharata**, the heroic figure of **Arjuna**, one of the Pandava princes, faced a moment of deep tragedy and loss due to a game of dice, a pivotal incident that altered the course of the epic tale.

## **The Setting:**

The great city of Hastinapura was the stage for a disastrous game of dice. **Yudhishthira**, the eldest of the Pandava brothers and renowned for his sense of duty and righteousness, was lured into a game by the cunning **Shakuni**, Duryodhana's uncle. Unbeknownst to Yudhishthira, the game was rigged from the beginning, with deceit and treachery at its core.

## **The Wager:**

In this fateful game, Yudhishthira staked and lost his kingdom, his brothers, and even himself. Eventually, fueled by arrogance and malice, **Duryodhana**, the eldest Kaurava, proposed another round of gambling, this time involving **Draupadi**, the wife of the Pandavas. In a horrifying turn of events, Yudhishthira lost Draupadi in the game of dice as well.

## **Arjuna's Anguish:**

The news of Draupadi's humiliation and the loss of their kingdom shook the Pandavas to the core. Arjuna, known for his exceptional archery skills and courage, was unable to prevent this calamity due to the rules of the game. His inability to protect Draupadi and prevent the loss of their kingdom haunted him deeply.

## **The Exile:**

As a result of this treacherous gamble, the Pandavas were forced into exile for thirteen years, including one year in incognito. This exile became a period of great trials and tribulations, testing their resolve, unity, and faith.

## **Arjuna's Redemption:**

Arjuna, during the exile, sought divine weapons and wisdom, preparing himself for the inevitable war against the Kauravas. His determination to regain his kingdom and seek justice for the injustice suffered by the Pandavas became the driving force behind his actions.
